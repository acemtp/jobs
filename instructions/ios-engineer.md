## Calendar and Agenda Views

Build an iOS app that replicates the basic features described below of the Calendar and Agenda views on the [Sunrise iOS (iPhone) app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sunrise-calendar./id599114150?mt=8).

We've highlighted the primary features of each of these views below. You can decide which other details to implement and any new features you can come up with.

The agenda view is a freely scrolling view that allows the user to browse events in chronological order. Moving between dates should update the information displayed in the Calendar view.

## Bonus: Networking Challenge

Integrate an internet data source to retrieve the weather forecast for the user. The weather forecast is listed in the 'Morning', 'Afternoon', and 'Evening' cells of the Agenda view. Here are some weather data providers: [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/), [Wunderground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/), and [Yahoo](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)
